# WiDS 2023 - Codeup Submission
## Predict the arithmetic mean of the max and min observed temperature over the next 14 days for specific locations and start dates

## Project Description
???

## Project Goals
* Determine which columns to use for our data exploration.
* Explore to find features that indicate the ```contest-tmp2m-14d__tmp2m```.
* Based on the findings predict the ```contest-tmp2m-14d__tmp2m``` for the test_data.
* Submit our finidings to the WiDS 2023 competition.

## Initial Thoughts
My initial hypothesis is that location, elevation and wind measurements will be indicators of the temperature.

## The Plan
* Aqcuire the data from Kaggle

* Prepare data
    * Remove all columns besides those listed ```contest``` or location indicators.

    * ????

* Explore data in search of indicators of ```contest-tmp2m-14d__tmp2m``` 
    * Answer the following initial questions
        * Does ??????? indicate ```contest-tmp2m-14d__tmp2m``` ?
        * Does ??????? indicate ```contest-tmp2m-14d__tmp2m``` ?
        * Does ??????? indicate ```contest-tmp2m-14d__tmp2m``` ?
        * Does ??????? indicate ```contest-tmp2m-14d__tmp2m``` ?

* Develop a model to predict ```contest-tmp2m-14d__tmp2m``` ?
    * Use indicators identified through exploration to build different predictive models
    * Evaluate models on train and validate data
    * Evaluate the best model on the test data

* Draw conclusions
