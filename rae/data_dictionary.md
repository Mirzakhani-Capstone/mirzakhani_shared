|mei__mei|	|Multivariate ENSO index: The El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) - a naturally occurring anomalous state of tropical Pacific coupled ocean-atmosphere conditions - is the primary predictor for global climate disruptions. (sea level pressure (SLP), sea surface temperature (SST), zonal and meridional components of the surface wind, and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR)|

|mjo1d__amplitude|	|Madden-Julian Oscillation amplitude: An MJO is measured by an amplitude per day. The amplitude is comprised of three components: outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) at thetop of the atmosphere, 200 hPa zonal wind, and 850 hPa zonal wind. A relative index was created to categorized the amplitude from weak to strong.|
|mjo1d__phase|	|Madden-Julian Oscillation phase: The MJO consists of two parts, or phases: one is the enhanced rainfall (or convective) phase and the other is the suppressed rainfall phase|
